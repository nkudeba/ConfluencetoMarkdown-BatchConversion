# ConfluencetoMarkdown-BatchConversion

This script converts HTML files exported from confluence into Markdown files, while keeping the same file names and links as their titles in Confluence. 

To run this tool, you must have node installed on your computer. Place the .js file in the same folder as the HTML files. To run the script open up Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows) and run ```node Confluence_to_Markdown.js```
